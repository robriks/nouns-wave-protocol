## State Variables

### nounsGovernor

```solidity
INounsDAOLogicV4 public nounsGovernor;
```

### nounsToken

```solidity
IERC721Checkpointable public nounsToken;
```

### \_\_creationCodeHash

```solidity
bytes32 private __creationCodeHash;
```

### ideaTokenHub

```solidity
IIdeaTokenHub public ideaTokenHub;
```

### \_optimisticDelegations

Since delegations can be revoked directly on the Nouns token contract, active delegations are handled optimistically

```solidity
Delegation[] private _optimisticDelegations;
```

### \_nextDelegateId

Declared as `uint16` type to efficiently pack into storage structs, but used as `uint256` or `bytes32`
when used as part of `create2` deployment or other function parameter

_Identifier used to derive and refer to the address of Delegate proxy contracts_

```solidity
uint16 private _nextDelegateId;
```

## Functions

### constructor

```solidity
constructor();
```

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(
    address ideaTokenHub_,
    address nounsGovernor_,
    address nounsToken_,
    uint256 minSponsorshipAmount_,
    uint256 waveLength_,
    string memory uri
) public virtual initializer;
```

### pushProposals

May only be called by the Wave's ERC1155 Idea token hub at the conclusion of each 2-week wave

_Pushes the winning proposal onto the `nounsGovernor` to be voted on in the Nouns governance ecosystem
Checks for changes in delegation state on `nounsToken` contract and updates Wave recordkeeping accordingly_

```solidity
function pushProposals(IWave.Proposal[] calldata winningProposals)
    public
    payable
    returns (IWave.Delegation[] memory delegations, uint256[] memory nounsProposalIds);
```

### delegateBySig

The Nouns ERC721Checkpointable implementation only supports standard EOA ECDSA signatures and thus
does not support smart contract signatures. In that case, `delegate()` must be called on the Nouns contract directly

_Simultaneously creates a delegate if it doesn't yet exist and grants voting power to the delegate
in a single function call. This is the most convenient option for standard wallets using EOA private keys_

```solidity
function delegateBySig(WaveSignature calldata waveSig) external;
```

### registerDelegation

Delegation to must have been performed via a call to the Nouns token contract using either the
`delegate()` or `delegateBySig()` function, having provided the correct Delegate address for the given ID

_Updates this contract's storage to reflect delegations performed directly on the Nouns token contract_

```solidity
function registerDelegation(address nounder, uint256 delegateId) external;
```

### createDelegate

As the constructor argument is appended to bytecode, it affects resulting address, eliminating risk of DOS vector

_Deploys a Delegate contract deterministically via `create2`, using the `_nextDelegateId` as salt_

```solidity
function createDelegate() public returns (address delegate);
```

### getDelegateAddress

_Computes the counterfactual address for a given delegate ID whether or not it has been deployed_

```solidity
function getDelegateAddress(uint256 delegateId) public view returns (address delegate);
```

### getDelegateId

Intended for offchain devX convenience only; not used in a write capacity within protocol

_Returns the `delegateId` for a given delegate address by iterating over existing delegates to find a match_

```solidity
function getDelegateId(address delegate) external view returns (uint256 delegateId);
```

### getDelegateIdByType

_Returns either an existing delegate ID if one meets the given parameters, otherwise returns the next delegate ID_

```solidity
function getDelegateIdByType(uint256 minRequiredVotes, bool isSupplementary) public view returns (uint256 delegateId);
```

```
