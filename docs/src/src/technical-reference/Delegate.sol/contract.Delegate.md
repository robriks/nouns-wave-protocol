All Wave Protocol Delegate contracts are managed by the Wave Core. They are designed to receive
Nouns token delegation non-custodially so they can be used as proxies to push onchain proposals to Nouns governance.

For utmost security, Delegates never custody Nouns tokens and can only push proposals
